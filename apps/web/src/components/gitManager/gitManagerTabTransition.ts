 * - a merge that appears, or is pending on opening, selects Changes, where it is finished;
 * - a checkout that becomes clean selects History: opening on a clean checkout, a commit or
 *   discard that cleans a dirty one, or a merge that ends on a clean tree. Tags is unrelated

 * A manual tab pick changes no input, so it is never overridden. An unreadable status is not
 * a clean checkout, and the readable status after it starts a new baseline rather than a
 * transition, so neither a Git failure nor its recovery moves the tab.
