//! Detects workspace changes made outside the application.
//!
//! The workspace index is a set of paths, not file contents, so only path-set changes can
//! invalidate it. On every filesystem BiBCode targets, adding, renaming, or removing an entry
//! updates the containing directory's mtime, while editing a file in place does not. The sweep
//! therefore stats the directories the index already knows about instead of walking the tree, which
//! keeps the cost proportional to the directory count rather than the file count.
