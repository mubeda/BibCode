# AGENTS.md

## Required Pre-Work

Before non-trivial diagnosis, design, or implementation:

1. Read every applicable `AGENTS.md` from the repository root to the files in
   scope.
2. Run `git status --short`; preserve unrelated user changes.
3. State the requested outcome, constraints, affected packages, and evidence
   that will prove completion.
4. If the `codegraph` binary is available on `PATH`, run `codegraph sync .`
   from the repository root so failures remain visible. If and only if it fails
   because CodeGraph is not initialized in that repository or worktree, run
   `codegraph init` there and then retry `codegraph sync . --quiet`. A CodeGraph
   graph is usable only after the initial sync or the post-initialization retry
   succeeds; successful commands may update ignored generated `.codegraph/`
   data.
5. If the binary is unavailable, initialization fails, or the initial/retried
   sync fails for any other reason, disclose that graph data is unavailable,
   stale, or unusable and immediately continue with `rg`, manifests, tests, and
   direct source inspection. Do not block the task or repeatedly retry.

Do not hand-edit, stage, or commit `.codegraph/` data. Apart from the narrowly
scoped uninitialized-worktree fallback above, do not install, initialize,
unlock, repair, or fully re-index CodeGraph unless the user explicitly requests
it. When and only when the graph is usable, use its relationship and impact
queries for unfamiliar or cross-package code, then confirm critical findings
in source and tests.

For non-trivial code work, read `docs/README.md`,
`docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/reference/workspace-layout.md`, and
`docs/reference/scripts.md`, then read the task-relevant living documentation
linked by the index. Also inspect the closest package README and manifest,
public contracts, existing tests, and CI configuration. Inspect recent history
for affected paths when intent is unclear.

Documentation-only and very small mechanical work may use the relevant subset
only after consulting `docs/README.md`. This keeps the workflow proportionate
without letting agents skip documentation discovery.

## Evidence and Documentation

- Source, schemas, manifests, tests, and CI are executable evidence of current
  behavior.
- Living documentation states intended current architecture and supported
  behavior.
- `docs/plans/`, `docs/superpowers/`, dependency reports, and dated
  measurements are historical evidence only; verify their paths, commands, and
  designs before reuse.
- `.repos/` contains read-only upstream examples, not application dependencies
  or BiBCode behavior.

Investigate disagreements by tracing the relevant call path and tests. Either
align living documentation in the same change or report the unresolved
discrepancy.

## Testing Runbook Maintenance

`docs/testing/` contains the living procedures for repeatable native Windows,
Linux, and macOS validation. Review and update the affected runbooks in the same
change whenever work modifies:

- test commands, package scripts, test targets, or CI/static gates;
- desktop build, packaging, signing, or artifact-discovery procedures;
- supported operating-system or environment presentation;
- provider visibility or availability;
- worktree discovery, adoption, identity, persistence, or removal;
- process admission, ownership, cancellation, shutdown, reaping, or cleanup;
- packaged UI flows included in native visual validation; or
- required validation evidence or the execution-report schema.

Verify procedures against current source, manifests, scripts, tests, CI, and
release workflows. Historical plans and prior reports are not current command
sources without that verification. Execution-specific SHAs, versions, test
counts, timings, screenshots, logs, and machine paths belong in reports created
from the template, not in living runbooks. When affected runbooks need no
change, state in the final report that they were **reviewed and remain
accurate**.

## Architectural Decision Standards

Before editing, identify:

- owning package and permitted dependency direction;
- callers, consumers, schemas, persistence formats, and public boundaries;
- state owner and source of truth;
- relevant failure, cancellation, reconnect, restart, concurrency, duplicate
  delivery, stale-result, and partial-stream behavior;
- authentication, process, filesystem, network, remote-environment, provider,
  and desktop-bridge trust boundaries;
- CPU, memory, queue, task, I/O, cloning, and backpressure behavior on hot
  paths;
- existing tests and living documents that define the behavior.

Treat these as hard runtime boundaries: privileged desktop operations must cross
`DesktopBridge` commands/events, and normal application traffic must use typed
HTTP/WebSocket RPC in browser and desktop modes.

Make the smallest coherent change that preserves repository boundaries. Improve
the correct shared abstraction when multiple consumers need the same policy,
while avoiding speculative generalization, duplicate sources of truth,
compatibility aliases without a requirement, hidden fallbacks, and unrelated
cleanup.

Change the corresponding living architecture document in the same patch whenever
package ownership, protocol flow, persisted shape, runtime topology, lifecycle
guarantees, security boundaries, or documented invariants change. Record
alternatives and trade-offs in an approved design document before implementing a
non-trivial new architectural decision. If that decision lacks an approved
design, pause implementation until its alternatives and trade-offs are
presented and approved.

## Implementation Quality

Before editing, define observable success and relevant failure cases. Inspect
the existing implementation and tests, and update the closest behavioral
coverage.

- Keep changes scoped to the requested outcome and necessary architectural
  support.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Follow existing naming, errors, logging, schema, and module conventions.
- Keep shared logic in the package that owns it; do not duplicate policy.
- Update documentation, examples, fixtures, schemas, and contracts together
  when public behavior changes.
- Test public behavior and important failure/lifecycle seams, not private
  implementation details.
- Run focused tests after each meaningful behavior change.

## Task Completion Requirements

No task is complete until all applicable requirements have evidence:

1. Focused tests for every changed behavior.
2. Broader package, integration, build, or end-to-end checks when the change
   crosses package or runtime boundaries.
3. Successful `vp check` and `vp run typecheck`.
4. For Rust changes, `cargo fmt --all --check`, relevant Rust tests, and Clippy
   for affected targets with warnings denied.
5. For React changes under `apps/web`, a review of the changed components and
   hooks against the `vercel-react-best-practices` skill
   (`/vercel-react-best-practices`) — always, not only when performance is
   suspected. An agent without access to that skill must report this check as
   not run instead of skipping it silently.
6. For any change to what a user sees or interacts with — new or reworked
   screens, panels, dialogs, menus, forms, empty and error states, copy, or
   interaction flows — a review against [`UI.md`](UI.md) at the repository
   root. It governs design quality: matching the user's mental model, keeping
   defaults safe and unsurprising, making disabled states explain themselves,
   making errors actionable, and preserving user work.

   These two reviews cover different failures and neither substitutes for the
   other. `vercel-react-best-practices` asks whether the component is built
   correctly — render behaviour, hook rules, wasted work. `UI.md` asks whether
   the thing built is the right thing for the person using it. A panel can be
   flawlessly memoised and still ask a question the user cannot answer.

7. Final `git diff` and `git status --short` review for unintended edits,
   generated files, debug output, dependency drift, and missing documentation.
8. A synced configured vendored subtree when its matching dependency changes.
9. Report the exact validation commands, any command that could not run, and
   residual risk.

`vp test` is the built-in Vite+ test command and `vp run test` is the workspace
package-script graph. Select broader checks according to risk; a broad suite
does not replace focused coverage for changed behavior.

## Project Snapshot

BiBCode is a web and Tauri desktop GUI for using coding agents like Codex and Claude.

This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long-term maintainability is a core priority. Keep designs understandable and
evolvable as the codebase grows.

## Package Roles

- `apps/desktop`: Tauri 2 desktop host written in Rust. Owns native windows,
  menus, dialogs, updates, WSL/SSH launch, and the `DesktopBridge`
  implementation. It starts the Rust server as an in-process runtime.
- `apps/server`: Rust/Axum/Tokio application server and native `bibcode` CLI.
  Owns HTTP/WebSocket RPC, authentication, persistence, orchestration,
  providers, terminals, Git, files, diagnostics, relay integration, and process
  supervision.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and client applications. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@bibcode/shared/git`) — no barrel index.
- `packages/client-runtime`: Shared connection, RPC, cache, and environment runtime used by browser and Tauri clients.

Node.js and TypeScript are development dependencies for the frontend and
repository tooling only. Do not add a production Node runtime, Electron host,
TypeScript server, or native helper sidecar.

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex
- Codex-Monitor (Tauri, feature-complete, strong reference implementation): https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.

## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under `.repos/` as read-only reference material for coding
agents.

- Prefer examples and patterns from the vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under `.repos/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from `.repos/`; application code must continue importing from normal package dependencies.
- Manage vendored snapshots with `vp run sync:repos`; use `vp run sync:repos --repo <id>` to sync one
  configured repository. Sync requires a clean index and working tree, stages
  only the exact fetched snapshot replacement for review, treats every
  configured Git path as literal, and creates no commit. One atomic
  `bibcode-reference-repos-sync.lock` file in the absolute Git common directory
  serializes sync across linked worktrees from the initial clean check through
  apply or verified rollback. A busy command exits before fetch. Success,
  pre-apply failure, and verified recovery remove the lock; a failed, timed-out,
  or unverified rollback deliberately leaves it in place. Never remove a stale
  or retained lock until you have verified that no reference-repository sync
  process owns that repository and the index/worktree is recovered; then remove
  only that exact lock file.
- When updating a dependency with a configured vendored subtree, sync that subtree in the same change so
  `.repos/` matches the installed dependency version.
- When writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` first and inspect `.repos/effect-smol/` for
  examples of idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
- When writing relay infrastructure code with Alchemy, inspect `.repos/alchemy-effect/` for examples of
  idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
