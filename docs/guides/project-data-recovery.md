# Project data safety and recovery

BiBCode stores its project catalog in a Rust/SQLite server store, separately
from the installed application files. A normal in-place application update
replaces the application and should retain the selected store. If projects are
missing, do not assume that the old database was deleted: a different account,
home, explicit root, state kind, symlink/junction target, WSL distribution, or
remote endpoint can select another store and produce the same symptom.

Do not copy, rename, delete, or open `state.sqlite`, its WAL/SHM files, or the
`environment-id` marker while any BiBCode process is running. Close BiBCode and
its local/WSL backends first, then use the desktop recovery dialog or the
offline `bibcode storage inspect` command.

## What identifies a store

The base root defaults to the current user's `~/.bibcode`. For the server, an
explicit `--base-dir` wins over `BIBCODE_HOME`; desktop bootstrap configuration
can also supply the root. Installed desktop builds use the `userdata` state
kind and development builds use `dev`. They normally share the base root but
do not share the state directory.

The recovery dialog shows:

- **Requested root:** the configured path before filesystem aliases are
  resolved.
- **Effective root:** the canonical location after symlinks, junctions, and
  existing ancestors are resolved.
- **Storage ID:** the persistent `storageInstanceId` stored in the
  `environment-id` marker.
- **Verified backups:** the newest three verified generations for that storage
  identity and state kind. Backups are created before a migration and before a
  coordinated in-app update.

An alias warning means that the requested and effective roots differ. It is not
itself corruption, but changing the target of an alias selects different data.
Normal server descriptors publish the storage UUID and never publish either
root or alias diagnostics.

## Recovery workflow

1. Close every BiBCode window and verify that no native or WSL BiBCode process
   owns the selected root. Do not stop a process by deleting its files.
2. Open **Project data recovery** from the affected local environment. The
   dialog is available only for desktop-owned native and WSL backends; remote
   bearer/relay/SSH stores must be recovered on their owning machine.
3. Compare requested root, effective root, and Storage ID with the environment
   you intended to open, and confirm whether you launched an installed
   (`userdata`) or development (`dev`) build. Use **Open data folder** only
   after the target is stopped. **Export diagnostics** produces bounded
   redacted evidence rather than database contents or credentials.
4. Prefer **Restore selected backup** when a verified generation contains the
   intended store. Restore verifies identity, location, checksum, SQLite
   integrity, and migration history, preserves the current live files, then
   installs the selected generation under the storage-operation lock.
5. Use **Start empty** only when you deliberately want a new store. The current
   database, sidecars, and marker are preserved first; they are not deleted.
   The new UUID still requires explicit client adoption before normal retry.

The project list is intentionally conservative during this process. Cached
projects remain visible through reconnect, degradation, unavailability,
storage mismatch, and recovery. **No projects yet** is valid only after the
environment catalog has loaded, at least one environment is desired, and every
desired environment has supplied a successful live authoritative snapshot that
is genuinely empty.

## Limits and unrelated leftovers

The first release that creates and checks storage UUIDs cannot detect a switch
that happened earlier between two otherwise valid unmarked BiBCode databases.
Protection begins when a database receives an `environment-id` UUID and the
client records it. Preserve any older roots until the intended store has been
identified and backed up.

BiBCode has no T4Code compatibility, migration, scanning, or automatic
adoption. T4Code leftovers are inert unless `BIBCODE_HOME`, `--base-dir`, a
desktop launch plan, or a remote endpoint explicitly points current BiBCode at
them. If they overlap the selected current root, the current marker/database
classifier applies and fails closed; BiBCode does not reinterpret them as a
legacy store.
