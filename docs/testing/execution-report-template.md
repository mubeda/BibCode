## Pull Requests evidence

- Packaged sidebar route smoke (`pierre-pull-requests-route.png`), native target and exact executable:
- Authenticated read-only list → detail → Files smoke: request, route/`tab=files`, real patch and reload screenshots:
- Unavailable/no-remote fixture evidence (separate from list/detail/files pass):
- Web zero-telemetry regression: image/avatar fixtures, actor initials, idle hour and explicit query/action counts:
- Server source/command tripwires, complete module inventory and checkout deadline exception:
- Listener-bound checks blocked with exact command, test name and bind error (never passed/skipped):
- Separate GitHub and GitLab live-host outcomes; unavailable host/authentication and remaining verification:

- Review surface: comment/edit/delete confirmation, reactions, reply/resolve,
  gutter single/range anchors, pending counter, suggestion single/batch apply,
  dismissal message/confirmation, reviewer re-request:
- Draft navigation/reload/failure retention and loaded-head submission:
- Full/partial/zero-landed receipts, posted-summary handling, failed-body matching, and stale-head Refresh:

- Review action argv/env/body evidence, private-file mode and cleanup:
- GitLab Note-subtype GlobalIDs, inline suggestion reads and label/milestone resource events:
- Cold/warm per-action process counts, bounded context expiry/Rescan and fresh permission/head refusals:
- Fresh denial/stale-head no-mutation evidence and duplicate-toggle no-ops:
- GitHub atomic / GitLab partial review failures, posted counts and refresh-before-retry:
- New GraphQL documents and separate live-host validation or exact blocked error:
- Diff refs, binary rows, per-file/whole-patch caps, and pagination limits:
- Per-host authentication display and account redaction:
- Tabs/counts, filters, lazy vocabularies, pagination, Refresh, and scroll restoration:
- Detail active-tab reads, cached-open refresh, and authentication recovery:
- Conversation kinds, remote-image links, file anchors, and responsive metadata:

- Read-only merge without a method selector; GitHub auto/bypass exclusion; GitLab current dual permission:
- Auto-merge enabled versus merged result, Disable, Update branch/Rebase and GitLab Skip CI:
- Draft/state/lock actions, host lock reasons, Revert creation/navigation and permanent GitLab Delete/list navigation:
- Partial-progress messages, no automatic write retry, late completion without navigation hijack, and no Base UI console errors:
- Edit/merge/state exact commands, numeric milestone lookup, and full-list people updates:
- Merge head/method/permission rejections, bypass ordering, auto-merge result, and private message transport:
- Revert branch/commit/create sequence, per-step failures and partial progress, GitLab deletion, and new live GraphQL validation:
- Rescan after origin/account changes; absence of stale rows/picker data:
- Unavailable/error messages, copyable auth advice, Retry, and Clear filters:
- Disconnected-environment behavior and no unintended connection:
- Git Manager link checkout scope and creation-dialog cancellation:
- Module DOM/network/idle evidence (no external images or provider polling):
- React best-practice review and UI.md review:
- Blocked commands and exact errors; browser/native scenarios still unverified:

## Git Manager evidence

- Project/environment and selected checkout:
- Environment kind: Local | WSL direct | SSH/server | Other remote | Unavailable
- Advertised Git Manager capabilities:
- Repository shape: ordinary | linked worktrees | unborn | detached | conflicted
- Ref storage coverage: files | reftable | reftable unsupported (record Git version/skip)
- Watch plan (native recursive worktree watch; targeted external metadata stores; object stores filtered) and sibling HEAD/reftable-only invalidation:
- Submodule commit/checkout refreshes the superproject; hundreds of nested ref directories start no registration work or rescan:
- Stash push/pop/drop after idle (empty and existing stash reflog, non-top drop) with Stashes open; closed pane reads no stash list and opening it lists the new entry:
- Windows upper-case metadata path classification:
- Non-blocking wakeups (stalled focus consumer; `application-active` never dropped):
- History retained refresh (one batch per external change, labels equal `git log --decorate`, selection/scroll kept, Retry banner):
- History first-page reads (one read on open; in-app operation while degraded refreshes; one change never causes two reads):
- Remote/local reconciliation stress-loop count and signature-failure publication:
- Idle interval provider/browser request evidence:
- Streaming operation event sequence and cancellation result:
- Interrupted and disconnected inline read against a stalled remote (interrupt exit; transport-helper connection closed):
- Competing catalog/Git Manager mutation and `operation-in-flight` result:

- Shutdown/exit result:
- Checksum result:
- Optional Minisign result or explicitly unsigned state:

- Exact executable launched:
- Exact PID/start identity:
- Other installed or development copies excluded:
- External tool, command, and path used for the Files Refresh rescan:
- Authentication-dependent scenarios unavailable:

## External-worktree scenario

- Disposable repository root:
- Git-reported worktrees:
- Physical/path-alias identities:
- Discovery result:
- Adoption/idempotence result:
- Restart result:
- Hide/remove non-destructive result:
- Final on-disk verification:

## Remote-server updates

- Settings/card confirmation, fresh counts, Cancel, and Retry reconfirmation:
- Progress/queued/restart/version checking, closing the view, and row Dismiss:
- Manual archive/package/OS/architecture/SSH steps and Copy:
- Browser explicit Reload and composer input retained:
- Host request notice and Manage devices (native | tests-only | unavailable):

- Before/after boot, version, storage identity and project retention:
- Observed percentages/stages, verified backup and requester log counts:
- Linux scoped AppImage mount/runtime counts and cleanup evidence:
- Exact commands, unavailable checks and residual risk:

## Clone from URL network scenario

- Throttled remote size, rate, and clone duration (> 30 s) with dialog close after registration:
- Cancel: notice, destination removal, immediate retry result:
- Stalled transfer: failure time and exact message, destination removal:
- Incomplete-clone refusal message, folder kept, Git Manager "No commits yet":
- Connection drop: outage length, reconnecting line shown, clone duration, registration after reconnect:
- Fixture duration or slow-rate method used to keep the clone running through each event:
- Cancel across a reconnect: Cancelling… line; for each variant (disconnected, reconnected, Cancel then drop), whether the clone was partial ("Clone cancelled.", folder removed) or completed (the finished-before-cancel notice, folder kept and not added, next Clone adds it):
- Dialog closed while reconnecting: close button shown, dialog closed, folder removed after the connection returned, and whether a new Clone of that URL into that folder waited for the cancel, then started:
- Server restart mid-clone: partial or completed at the stop; partial folder removed at shutdown and the exact "No clone is in progress…" message, or the completed clone added:
- Window closed mid-clone: whether the host kept cloning, and the result of re-cloning the same URL into the same folder (joined or added):

## Slow-link liveness scenario

- Server, web, and proxy ports; fixture diff size:
- First config snapshot size in bytes (network panel); size ÷ rate exceeds 15 seconds at the tested rates:
- 16 KiB/s: time to connected, attempt count, setup timeout seen (none expected):
- 8 KiB/s: time to connected, attempt count, setup timeout seen (none expected):
- 4 KiB/s: time to connected or session end, attempt count, deciding bound (buffered delivery or server write deadline):
- Slow-setup text after 5 seconds receiving settings, and whether it cleared on connection:
- Freeze during configuring: seconds from the freeze until the 'No data from' status (at most 33), exact banner text, reconnect after thawing:
- 64 KiB/s: transfer duration, negotiated subprotocol, binary frames seen, disconnects (none expected), slow-request warning text and whether it cleared:
- 256 KiB/s: transfer duration, disconnects (none expected):
- Frozen link: seconds until the 4408 close, exact status text, reconnect after thawing; the next attempt's failure time (at most 15 seconds after it starts) and text:
- Idle freeze: freeze-start and server teardown timestamps; elapsed seconds (at most 50), observed before thaw:
- Transfer freeze: freeze-start and server teardown timestamps; elapsed seconds (at most 33), observed before thaw; subscription cleanup evidence:

### Staged chat attachment upload evidence

- Carrying-session `attachmentStaging`, plain/pinned E2EE transport, source byte count and digest:
- Upstream rate/latency and duration at 64 KiB/s and 16 KiB/s; acknowledged progress samples and maximum outstanding appends:
- Concurrent stream and Stop latency; upload completion without 4408; provider fixture received-byte/digest comparison:
- Multi-file duration over ten minutes, completed-stage get activity touches, non-overlapping keeper requests and joined cleanup on all exits:
- Freeze timestamp, 4408 timestamp (within 33 seconds), resume checkpoint after thaw, earlier-file restart/expiry outcome and once-per-file budget:
- Cancel using pointer, Tab/Enter and Tab/Space on separate uploads; abort count, error-banner absence and usable restored previews:
- New composer edits plus restored outgoing prompt, attachments, terminal/element context, annotations and review comments:
- Queued upload local row before admission, queue acceptance and exactly-once local-row removal:
- Route/unmount during pending admission: no premature cancel, keeper join at outcome, old-draft restoration/new-draft preservation:
- Real unmount/remount before/after ambiguity settlement; unchanged replay, zero restaging, fresh-edit retention and concurrent-view fence:
- Current permission/session rotation on same store; blocked/removal and host/store replacement fences with unresolved intent retained:
- Lost accepted reply: exact command/message/timestamp/upload-ID replay, zero reupload, changed-composer retention; typed not_found and subsequent fresh send:
- Old-server inline fallback, no `uploads.*` probes, failed-admission reuse, and abandoned-stage cleanup:
- Light/dark upload and reconnect/Cancel screenshots:
- Browser queued-data-after-close/Ping-Pong probe; WebKitGTK measured or explicitly not measured:

## SSH environment evidence

See [Desktop-managed SSH environments](./ssh-environments.md).

- Automated harness command and result (`ssh_environment`, `--ignored`):
- Remote host OS and login shell:
- Authentication methods exercised (key, password):
- Remote `bibcode --version`:
- Devices for this desktop on the host before (count, access):
