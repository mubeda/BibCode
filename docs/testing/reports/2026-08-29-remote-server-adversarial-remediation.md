# Platform Validation Execution Report

**Result:** PASS WITH RESIDUAL RISKS

## Tested revision

- Repository: BiBCode (`https://github.com/mubeda/BibCode.git`)
- Remote: `origin`; requested publication branch `develop`
- Branch or requested revision: local `mubeda/develop`; adversarial-remediation
  range `e3cd9d81b4cee897fb42709f88ca9f1509c85ba1..f3eb0ab763e4a521ad5efbdccce365991f66fdfd`
- Local HEAD: `f3eb0ab763e4a521ad5efbdccce365991f66fdfd` was the executable
  remediation HEAD during validation. The final documentation/evidence commit
  follows it.
- Remote HEAD before publication: `origin/develop` at
  `e3cd9d81b4cee897fb42709f88ca9f1509c85ba1`
- Merge base and ahead/behind before publication: merge base `e3cd9d81`; remote
  versus local `0 16`
- Dirty state before execution: two pre-existing staged environment-project
  document deletions and the untracked adversarial-review document, plus the
  intended Task 14 documentation and Docker-test edits
- Dirty state after execution: the same three protected user-owned paths plus
  the intended Task 14 edits and this report; no generated or container-owned
  resource remained

## Native environment

- Operating system and release/build: Fedora Linux 44 Workstation
- Architecture: `x86_64` / `linux/amd64`
- Kernel: `Linux 7.1.10-200.fc44.x86_64`
- Rust/Cargo: `rustc 1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14)`;
  `cargo 1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)`
- Node/package manager/Vite+: Node 26.5.0; pnpm 11.15.0 through Vite+; global
  Vite+ 0.3.0, repository Vite+ 0.2.5, Vitest 4.1.10
- Native compiler/SDK/runtime dependencies: the installed Linux development
  dependencies supported complete server and desktop test and Clippy matrices
- Optional capabilities: Docker CLI 29.7.2 used context `pathfinder-podman` and
  Podman Engine 5.8.4 on Linux/amd64. Windows/WSL, macOS, signing, notarization,
  and packaged installers were unavailable.

## Requested inputs and ancestry

- Expected product version: 0.4.1
- Observed version sources: server and desktop Cargo manifests
- Required commits: the 16 commits in the tested remediation range, beginning
  with `d4fe12a2` and ending with `f3eb0ab7`
- Ancestry result: the range is linear above `origin/develop`; every listed
  remediation commit is an ancestor of the tested HEAD
- Inputs that were unavailable: supported-platform packaged desktop builds,
  a second physical LAN device, Windows firewall/WSL evidence, macOS bundle
  evidence, signing/notarization, and authenticated provider credentials

Two non-green attempts were investigated rather than classified as baseline by
assumption:

- The first server run exposed a deterministic date-rotted activity fixture.
  The fixture predates the branch; its timestamp was repaired and the exact
  test plus a later complete server run passed.
- The next complete server attempt hit a pre-existing one-second OpenCode
  connection timeout under suite load. Git blame places the wait before this
  branch, five immediate isolated repeats passed, and the final complete server
  invocation passed.

## Cross-container remote-server gate

The exact current runbook block created a distinct server container and client
container on a test-owned network, mounted the current binary and checkout
read-only, used a dedicated state volume, and gave only Vite's cache path a
writable tmpfs.

- Runtime: Docker CLI 29.7.2 with API 1.44 against Podman Engine 5.8.4,
  `crun` 1.28, Fedora 44, Linux/amd64
- Server image: `debian:trixie-slim`,
  `sha256:e426a54f50cc4cf82dd5cab8ba8426ed02c391840cb5a62dfd987542dbabea3b`,
  Linux/amd64
- Client image: `node:26-bookworm`,
  `sha256:55d3eaf406db9ece10a4d68c6780e41020683453e7a8654d68370a2abddf41ed`,
  Linux/amd64
- Covered: descriptor/support negotiation, administrative exchange, four
  same-peer pre-auth leases and fifth-socket rejection, off-host pairing,
  pinned Noise NK authentication, authenticated RPC, status/check/manual
  install update behavior, a 2,049-record logical-message rejection,
  browser-session exposure retention, revocation and final loopback state,
  ambiguous offer cancellation, and delayed-retry rejection
- Cleanup: the exact filtered container, network, and volume listings produced
  no output. No custom image was built, so there was no test-created image to
  remove.

## Native package artifacts and packaged UI

| Artifact or scenario              | Path/evidence | State                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Native installer/package          | Unavailable   | No package or signing claim.                                          |
| Packaged remote sharing/update UI | Unavailable   | Source-level behavior and runbook coverage only; no screenshot claim. |

The exact executable exercised outside Cargo's test harness was this checkout's
`target/debug/bibcode`. No installed BiBCode copy was launched.

## Process and temporary-root cleanup

- Before and after snapshots: no `bibcode-remote-*` container,
  `bibcode-remote-stabilization` network, or
  `bibcode-remote-stabilization-data` volume remained
- Scoped surviving processes: none from direct interop or Docker smoke
- New test-owned roots: harness temporary roots were released; the Docker state
  volume was explicitly removed
- Pre-existing roots/processes intentionally left untouched: unrelated host,
  CodeGraph, workspace, and container-image state

## Non-native compatibility evidence

### Windows

- Evidence class: compatibility evidence plus unavailable native evidence
- Source/contracts reviewed: Windows desktop runbook, desktop exposure,
  firewall, WSL, endpoint enumeration, Tailscale, IndexedDB, update, and shared
  transport contracts
- Native-only evidence still required: packaged x64 UI, WSL topology changes,
  live firewall policy/timeout behavior, WebView2, Authenticode, and updater

### macOS

- Evidence class: compatibility evidence plus unavailable native evidence
- Source/contracts reviewed: macOS desktop runbook, endpoint/Tailscale,
  deep-link, IndexedDB, exposure, update, and shared transport contracts
- Native-only evidence still required: arm64/x64 package UI, bundle custom
  scheme, signing/notarization, and updater

The Linux, macOS, Windows, and cross-platform runbooks were reviewed and
updated. The connection-runtime runbook was reviewed and remains accurate.

## Source changes and commits created

- Remediation commits before this evidence patch:
  `d4fe12a2`, `2776f39b`, `e7b23a56`, `a0fecd32`, `1bcff049`,
  `9dcaf37d`, `a9c8bf09`, `072cad35`, `a06c40b5`, `89f4ec89`,
  `133ab5d8`, `6622d9a2`, `95e8c0c4`, `1b0c68c8`, `1e0a9b77`, and
  `f3eb0ab7`
- This final patch aligns living architecture, supersession notes, native
  runbooks, the architecture gate, the Docker smoke, its real-socket test
  helper, the Connect-tab mock seam, and the date-stable activity fixture.
- RED evidence: the architecture gate rejected stale exchange wording; the
  Connect-tab file failed 5 cases for a missing shared policy export; the
  activity test failed after crossing the real retention cutoff.
- GREEN evidence: exact focused reruns, the complete TypeScript suite, the final
  complete Rust package matrices, both Clippy targets, direct interop, and the
  cross-container test all passed.

## Residual risks

- Packaged updater, deep-link, exposure, and firewall visuals remain unverified
  on Windows and macOS. Contract, source, unit, integration, and Linux
  cross-container evidence bounds the risk but does not replace native package
  validation.
- The pre-existing OpenCode supervisor test can miss its one-second setup
  deadline under full-suite host contention. It passed five isolated repetitions
  and the final complete server run; this is test-harness timing risk outside the
  remote-server implementation.
