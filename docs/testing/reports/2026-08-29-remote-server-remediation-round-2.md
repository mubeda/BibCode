# Platform Validation Execution Report

**Result:** PASS WITH RESIDUAL RISKS

## Tested revision

- Repository: BiBCode (`https://github.com/mubeda/BibCode.git`)
- Remote: `origin`; requested publication branch `develop`
- Branch or requested revision: local `mubeda/develop`; remediation range
  `0e4767b5e8678a756377bb7f0071f98049e88dc0..65af2c1084e3c8f87eb0269cdac18ba3f056de3c`
- Executable HEAD: `d0acdfb841112b350b438eaa2b1cd34a21b6ae97`
  supplied the server, desktop, web, contracts, and client-runtime source used
  for final validation. Test-only HEAD
  `9a211c90e084762c626f468bde375a3efecafe75` removes an ambiguous session
  selector exposed by the broad server run. Documentation HEAD
  `65af2c1084e3c8f87eb0269cdac18ba3f056de3c` records the final auditor-verified
  authority rule. The evidence-only report commit follows it.
- Remote HEAD before publication: `origin/develop` at
  `0e4767b5e8678a756377bb7f0071f98049e88dc0`
- Merge base and ahead/behind before the report commit: merge base `0e4767b5`;
  remote versus local `0 18`
- Dirty state before execution: two pre-existing staged environment-project
  document deletions and two protected untracked adversarial-review documents,
  plus intended work before each scoped commit
- Dirty state after execution: only the same four protected user-owned paths and
  this report; no implementation, generated, process, or container resource
  remained uncommitted

## Native environment

- Operating system and release/build: Fedora Linux 44 Workstation
- Architecture: `x86_64` / `linux/amd64`
- Kernel: `Linux 7.1.10-200.fc44.x86_64`
- Rust/Cargo: `rustc 1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14)`;
  `cargo 1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)`
- Node/package manager/Vite+: Node 26.5.0; pnpm 11.15.0 through Vite+; global
  Vite+ 0.3.0, repository Vite+ 0.2.5, Vitest 4.1.10
- Native compiler/SDK/runtime dependencies: installed Linux development
  dependencies supported the complete server and desktop test, build, and
  Clippy matrices
- Optional capabilities: Docker CLI 29.7.2 used context `pathfinder-podman` and
  Podman Engine 5.8.4 with `crun` 1.28 on Linux/amd64. Windows/WSL, macOS,
  signing, notarization, and packaged installers were unavailable.

## Requested inputs and ancestry

- Expected product version: 0.4.1
- Observed version sources: server and desktop Cargo manifests
- Required commits: the 18 linear commits in the tested range, beginning with
  `52f0bfb3` and ending with `65af2c10`
- Ancestry result: every listed remediation commit is an ancestor of the tested
  HEAD, and the range is linear above the pre-execution `origin/develop`
- Inputs that were unavailable: supported-platform packaged desktop builds, a
  second physical LAN device, Windows firewall/WSL evidence, macOS bundle
  evidence, signing/notarization, and authenticated provider credentials

An independent SOL/xhigh adversarial audit of the final executable and
documentation range found no Critical or Important issue. It verified
absent-flag rolling compatibility against the exact `7d44829a` server,
confirmation ownership across handler cancellation and ambiguous responses,
and fail-closed native public/custom topology behavior. Its one documentation
inconsistency was corrected by `65af2c10` and re-reviewed.

The broad server command was not misreported as green. It exposed two distinct
issues:

- `delivered_pairing_session_stays_pending_until_confirm_rpc` selected the
  lexicographically latest session when the administrator and negotiated
  pairing shared one millisecond timestamp. It could therefore inspect the
  active administrator instead of the pending off-host session. Commit
  `9a211c90` selects the grant by `reach = another-device` and `off_host = 1`;
  the exact regression and complete 23-test E2EE target then passed.
- `server_starts_while_live_store_is_continuously_committed_and_checkpointed`
  intermittently returned `AuthInitialize(Internal("SQLite operation failed"))`
  under its injected concurrent writer/checkpoint. It failed in the broad run,
  then produced pass/fail/pass in three isolated executions. The test and
  exercised startup/checkpoint behavior predate this remediation range, and no
  changed authentication assertion failed around it.

## Cross-container remote-server gate

The current runbook block created a distinct Debian server container and
Node client container on a test-owned network, mounted the current binary and
checkout read-only, used a dedicated state volume, and gave only Vite's cache
path a writable tmpfs.

The first behavior run passed but revealed that Docker-compatible Podman treats
a multi-name `docker rm -f` atomically when one auto-removed name is absent. The
helper therefore left the server, network, and volume behind. Those exact
test-owned resources were removed individually, commit `21fbb198` split the two
container removals, and the complete gate was rerun. The final run passed both
behavior and empty-resource assertions.

- Runtime: Docker CLI 29.7.2 with API 1.44 against Podman Engine 5.8.4,
  `crun` 1.28, Fedora 44, Linux/amd64
- Server image: `debian:trixie-slim`,
  `sha256:e426a54f50cc4cf82dd5cab8ba8426ed02c391840cb5a62dfd987542dbabea3b`,
  Linux/amd64
- Client image: `node:26-bookworm`,
  `sha256:55d3eaf406db9ece10a4d68c6780e41020683453e7a8654d68370a2abddf41ed`,
  Linux/amd64
- Covered: descriptor and administrative exchange; off-host pairing; pinned
  Noise NK; pending share state; bootstrap `server.getConfig`; rejected bearer
  reconnect before confirmation; idempotent `auth.confirmPairing`; active bearer
  reconnect; maximum record plus delayed continuation; 16 MiB-plus-one plain
  frame rejection; updater check/manual failure/later health; same-peer pre-auth
  cap; 2,049-record rejection; browser exposure retention; active E2EE
  revocation; cancellation replay protection; and final loopback convergence
- Evidence partition: the fixed-IP client cannot independently exercise `/24`
  aggregation, which passed Rust classifier/admission tests. The headless
  container cannot inject a hung desktop updater delegate or supervisor
  acquisition; 30-second whole-operation timeout and slot release passed
  client-runtime tests.
- Cleanup: an independent post-run assertion produced
  `{"containers":"","network":"","volume":""}`. No scoped host process
  using the current binary and port 3773 remained.

## VCS observation evidence

- Execution host and route: unavailable for this remote-server remediation
- Physical repositories/worktrees/active full subscribers/passive subscribers:
  not measured
- Watcher health and fallback state: not measured
- Automatic-fetch interval and passive-summary interval: not in scope

No installed BiBCode copy was launched.

## Process and temporary-root cleanup

- Scoped surviving processes: none from direct interop or Docker smoke
- New test-owned roots: harness temporary roots were released; the Docker state
  volume was explicitly removed
- Package mounts or platform resources released: server/client containers,
  test-owned network, and test-owned volume were removed
- Pre-existing roots/processes intentionally left untouched: unrelated host,
  CodeGraph, workspace, and container-image state

## Non-native compatibility evidence

### Windows

- Evidence class: compatibility evidence plus unavailable native evidence
- Source/contracts reviewed: Windows desktop runbook, desktop exposure,
  firewall, WSL topology, endpoint enumeration, Tailscale, IndexedDB recovery,
  update, and shared transport contracts
- Native-only evidence still required: packaged x64 UI, WSL transitions, live
  firewall policy/timeout and late-cleanup behavior, WebView2, Authenticode, and
  updater validation

### macOS

- Evidence class: compatibility evidence plus unavailable native evidence
- Source/contracts reviewed: macOS desktop runbook, endpoint/Tailscale,
  deep-link, IndexedDB, exposure, update, and shared transport contracts
- Native-only evidence still required: arm64/x64 package UI, bundle custom
  scheme, signing/notarization, and updater validation

### Linux

- Evidence class: native source/build/test and container integration evidence;
  packaged desktop visual evidence unavailable
- Native-only evidence still required: packaged WebKitGTK UI, deep-link desktop
  integration, and manual LAN pairing on a second physical device

The Linux, macOS, Windows, and cross-platform runbooks were reviewed and
updated. `docs/architecture/connection-runtime.md` is the current owner for the
connection-runtime procedures; the planned `docs/testing/connection-runtime.md`
path has never existed.

| Raw `vp check` including the two untracked adversarial-review documents          | Both files are protected user-owned historical review input and are not formatter-clean; changing or committing them was outside scope.                                             | Owner of those review documents, if later committed.                                 |
| A wholly green `cargo test -p bibcode-server --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=1` | The run passed the changed library/auth surface but exposed the corrected E2EE selector and the separately reproduced pre-existing SQLite checkpoint/startup flake described above. | Server persistence owner should make the live-checkpoint startup seam deterministic. |
| Packaged desktop UI on Linux, Windows, and macOS                                 | No package/signing environment or supported-platform native hosts were available.                                                                                                   | Release validation on each supported platform.                                       |

## Residual risks

- Automatic native desktop sharing deliberately accepts only a private IPv4 or
  CGNAT endpoint. Public-only hosts must use an externally managed listener or
  reverse proxy; native public-address automation remains fail-closed.
- A server may commit `auth.confirmPairing` while its response is lost. The
  server now owns database-to-cache-to-latch activation after handler
  cancellation, and the client retains the durable credential whenever remote
  activation is possible. A bounded pinned bearer proof runs immediately and
  the saved supervisor owns later recovery; the UI does not yet distinguish
  immediate proof from retained recovery as separate success variants.
- A truly old protocol-v1 server activates its credential before the client can
  durably register it. Failure of that first local registration write can still
  leave a legacy server grant requiring manual revocation; eliminating that
  compatibility limit requires a legacy-compatible self-revoke protocol.
- A native-managed server that is already wide on a public-only topology safely
  exposes no selectable address and disables offer generation, but the UI's
  custom-listener/reverse-proxy guidance currently renders only while the
  server is local-only.
- Admission caps are process-local. They bound one server process and partition
  peer/subnet/principal pressure, but do not form a distributed cap across
  multiple simultaneously live processes sharing one store.
- Docker cannot independently prove the subnet classifier with one fixed client
  IP or inject the desktop updater/supervisor timeout seams. Focused Rust and
  client-runtime tests provide that evidence instead.
- Native firewall, WSL, packaged updater/deep-link, and visual flows remain
  unverified on Windows and macOS. Unit, contract, and Linux evidence bounds but
  does not replace native package validation.
- The pre-existing live-checkpoint server-start stress test remains
  intermittently red even in isolation. Its two passing and two failing
  executions in this validation bound the failure honestly but do not prove a
  production fix.
