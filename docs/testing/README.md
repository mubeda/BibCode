# Testing Runbooks

These runbooks describe BiBCode's current repeatable validation contract. They
are living documentation, not execution history.

## Choose a runbook

Start with the shared procedure, then use the page for the native host:

- [Shared cross-platform validation](./cross-platform-validation.md)
- [Windows desktop](./windows-desktop.md)
- [Linux desktop](./linux-desktop.md)
- [macOS desktop](./macos-desktop.md)
- [Desktop-managed SSH environments](./ssh-environments.md) (all three desktops;
  its automated harness runs on Linux and macOS)
- [Execution report template](./execution-report-template.md)
- [Flaky-test diagnosis](./flaky-tests.md)

## Evidence classes

- **Native evidence:** the command or scenario executed on the named operating
  system.
- **Compatibility evidence:** source, contract, fixture, or cross-target checks
  for another operating system.
- **Unavailable evidence:** a command or capability that could not execute and
  is reported with its exact blocker.

Never describe compatibility or unavailable evidence as a native pass. A
complete report separates all three classes.

Native release reports also separate desktop-installer evidence from standalone-server
archive/package evidence. Each architecture requires its own native result; one
architecture never proves another.

### Temporary Windows legacy RPC qualification

The optional `--previous-stable-trigger remote-rpc` seeded-upgrade selection is
restricted to native Windows CI. The default remains `local-bridge`. The
[temporary qualification workflow](../../.github/workflows/qualify-windows-legacy-rpc.yml)
pins the previous host to the original `v0.7.2` source and runs three separate
lanes on Windows x64 and ARM64: previous host through authenticated RPC,
current-source protected host through the local bridge, and current-source host
through RPC. The ordinary desktop-upgrade matrix is unchanged.

The old source is not patched or instrumented. All tracked files must match the
selected commit except the seven declared version files: only their package
version values may differ, with every other manifest/lock value and file mode
checked. This includes native build scripts, client runtime and root profiles.
The actual bridge/update/auth/maintenance hashes, build versions and trigger are recorded
before any lane starts; these records say `selected-not-yet-verified`. Only a
completed lane result says `verified`. Both RPC lanes retain the real held-upload
admission, protection progress, identity, backup, requester and process checks.
In this selection the starting app must also match the planned baseline version
after the existing observation/seeding step and before update-path credential,
grant or installer-driver commands. The controller checks it again at completion.
Their private receipts and joined cleanup belong to separate lane roots. A
missing required or malformed receipt prevents public evidence retention.
RPC residue removal requires two consecutive successful observations that the
desktop process name targeted by the existing CI cleanup plan is absent. Kill
results alone cannot authorize removal. Each read-only observation must finish
with closed, untruncated output streams; a signal, stderr or missing stream close
cannot stand in for absence. Unknown observations or exhausted stop attempts
fail qualification and preserve that owner's residue and receipts.

A pass qualifies this tag-source rebuild's authenticated migration route. It
does not fix or qualify the old local-bridge path, whose prior stack overflow
remains unresolved, or establish byte identity with a published installer.
Require all three results on both architectures before calling the temporary
trial complete. Native execution and any later version-scoped default-matrix
exception need separate review; do not run the packaged harness on a user's host.

## Living documentation and execution reports

The runbooks define current procedure and supported behavior. Branch names,
required commit SHAs, expected product versions, test counts, durations,
screenshots, logs, and machine paths are inputs or outputs of a particular run.
Record those values in a report created from the
[execution report template](./execution-report-template.md), not in these
pages.

Reports may live in CI artifacts, issue or pull-request attachments, or an
explicit local evidence directory. The runbooks do not prescribe one retention
owner. Never commit secrets, credentials, private user data, or unbounded logs.

## Operating rule

Read [Shared cross-platform validation](./cross-platform-validation.md) in full
before the native page. Source, manifests, scripts, tests, CI, and release
workflows remain executable evidence; if a runbook disagrees with them, stop,
classify the disagreement, and update the living documentation with the
behavior change.

Static lint evidence must be freshly re-derived rather than replayed from Cargo
cache. From the repository root, clean every workspace crate and then lint the
whole workspace with warnings denied:

```sh
cargo clean -p bibcode-server -p bibcode-desktop -p bibcode-updater-verifier
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Hermetic Rust fixtures

Automated Rust tests must never execute the host's provider or hosting CLIs,
perform real provider update checks, or use the user's HOME, shell rc files,
or `~/.ssh`. Use test-owned executables, configuration, and temporary roots.
Real Git may operate on disposable repositories with isolated Git configuration.

`TestSandbox` removes every inherited variable with a case-insensitive `GIT_`
prefix before applying explicit fixture environment overrides. This includes
discovery, worktree, index, object-store, and numbered configuration variables.
For command-based Git fixtures and isolated test re-execution, use
`IsolatedGitConfig::apply_to_command` from `tests/support/isolated_git_config.rs`
before adding intentional overrides; it removes inherited Git variables and
pins the fixture's configuration. Keep the configuration fixture alive until
the command exits. Production Git commands retain their normal inheritance.

Write executable fixtures with `tests/support/executable_fixture.rs` (lib tests:
`TestSandbox::write_executable`), never in-process `fs::write`/`fs::copy`, to prevent
fork-inherited writable descriptors from causing `ETXTBSY`.

Keep script fixtures and their temporary directories alive until the launched
process exits and is reaped; a returned PID alone does not prove the script ran.
Unix PTY launch checks cover missing-interpreter errors and successful relative
script completion. Preserve the spawn error handshake and close inherited
non-stdio descriptors only when exec succeeds.

Harnesses that start a production runtime or `NativeServerControl` with the
default provider registry use
[`tests/support/hermetic_providers.rs`](../../apps/server/tests/support/hermetic_providers.rs).
Harnesses with restricted registries or disabled providers are hermetic by
construction and need not use the helper.
Integration tests include it with `#[path = "support/hermetic_providers.rs"]`;
library tests use `crate::test_support::hermetic_providers`.
`write_hermetic_settings(&config.state_dir(), overlay)` disables update checks
and pins every built-in driver's legacy `binaryPath` to an absolute missing
path. It explicitly preserves the built-in enabled defaults in both settings
readers: Codex, Claude, Cursor, and OpenCode enabled; Grok disabled. It
deep-merges fixture overrides, including partial `providerInstances`, so
unspecified drivers stay pinned. `ensure_hermetic_settings` reads existing
settings as the overlay and writes the hermetic base beneath them; explicit
pinned-key overrides remain the fixture's responsibility. Read or parse errors
fail the test. Seed the same state directory before spawning `bibcode` with
`--base-dir`.

Tests exercising probes or updates must explicitly overlay test-owned binaries
and local endpoints. Use the discovery and Git VCS
`*_for_integration_test` executable-directory seams for hosting commands;
`missing_hosting_executable_dir` keeps them absent while preserving the real
Git version probe. The Git VCS seam also pins pull-request commands and their
passive-summary clone. Pass `isolated_terminal_home` as both `"HOME"` and
`"USERPROFILE"` in each terminal open, attach-that-starts, restart, or
setup-script environment. Do not mutate
process-global PATH or HOME to isolate parallel tests. SSH fixtures must use
test-owned SSH configuration and hosts.

Desktop in-process test runtimes pin hosting executables to a missing directory
under their isolated data root through
`ServerConfig::with_hosting_executable_dir_for_integration_test`. Desktop SSH
unreachable-target tests use an empty temporary SSH config (`-F`) and a literal
loopback destination with an empty alias, avoiding user config and DNS.

The desktop bridge IPC contract harness discovers SSH hosts from
`home/.ssh/config` and `home/.ssh/known_hosts` beneath its per-app
`IsolatedTestDataRoot`, and fails closed if that root is missing. On Linux it
injects a per-app system-theme reader into the real theme command, exercising
the blocking worker and unavailable-portal light fallback without contacting
the session D-Bus service. A missing test reader is an error; explicit light
and dark selections never consult it. Production commands retain native home
discovery and portal reads.

The server harnesses, including the library's `control.rs` and lifecycle tests,
and the desktop harnesses follow these rules. Cargo dev units enable the
[approved hermetic test guard](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-hermetic-test-guard-design.md),
which refuses host provider/hosting executable resolution and credential reads.
It defaults to Abort mode: a forbidden resolution or read writes the program,
path, and current thread name directly to stderr and aborts the test process.
This applies to spawned threads/tasks and re-executed or CLI test binaries too;
there is no off switch. For fixture diagnosis, set
`BIBCODE_HERMETIC_GUARD=report` on the test child only. Report mode still refuses
the operation, treating it as unavailable; it never executes the host CLI or
loads the host credentials. Repair every diagnostic before the default run.

Allowed executable/credential roots are the canonical temporary directory,
the server crate's compile-time `tests/fixtures`, a runtime
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/tests/fixtures` when supplied, and the Cargo profile derived
from the running executable only when `.fingerprint` is present. Canonical
checks reject symlinks escaping those roots. A guarded bare name on inherited
PATH is refused before lookup unless every existing entry is an absolute
allowed root; missing entries are ignored, while empty, relative, or unreadable
entries fail closed. An explicit fixture search path is checked after lookup,
and spawning uses the checked absolute candidate without an OS-search fallback.
On Windows, explicit extensionless names use launch extensions. Keychain access
is always refused in dev units; use fixture files instead.
The optional reviewed-Claude attestation and preparation-budget checks select
only `BIBCODE_CLAUDE_ATTESTATION_FIXTURE`, with the same root checks; they never
fall back to an installation in the developer's HOME. Keep their child HOME
and credential context disposable, and record the fixture provenance separately
when explicitly qualifying those optional checks.

Before any `NativeServerControl` or `ServerRuntime` construction, seed the exact
`ServerConfig::state_dir()` using `support/hermetic_providers.rs`; disabled
providers still need absent absolute fixture paths and disabled update checks.
For legitimate CLI behavior, pin a fake under an allowed root or re-execute the
test with a narrow fixture PATH. Never fix a diagnostic by using Report mode in
CI, allowing a host directory, or running a real provider/hosting CLI. Server
and desktop dev-dependencies activate the guard, including workspace tests;
normal dependencies and production builds leave it disabled. CI also checks
`cargo check -p bibcode-server --lib --bins -j 2` separately so production cfg
paths remain compiled, and builds SSH's CLI via the guarded `cli_smoke` dev unit.

## Static rendering and Zustand

`renderToStaticMarkup` reads Zustand's server snapshot, which uses
`getInitialState`, not the current `getState`. Calling `setState` or a store
action before that render does not change the snapshot selectors see. A
static-markup test can therefore keep rendering the default tab after the
test selects another one.

Use static markup for initial-state output. For a non-default state or a state
transition, render through `createRoot` inside `act` in a happy-dom test, or
verify the interaction in a live browser. Test pure selection logic directly
when DOM behavior is not the subject. `GitManagerPanel.test.tsx` contains
mounted tests that set the store before rendering. Follow the compiler-lane
guidance below when selecting the command.

## Web unit tests and the React Compiler

The web client build compiles components and hooks with the React Compiler.
Whether a web unit test runs compiled code depends on how it runs:

- **Web package (`vp run test`, which CI runs):** `apps/web/vite.config.ts`
  applies the compiler to Vite's client environment. Files marked
  `// @vitest-environment happy-dom` run through it exactly as the client build
  does. Node-environment files run in Vite's `ssr` environment, which the
  compiler preset skips, so they are uncompiled.
- **Repository root (`vp test`):** the root configuration runs no React
  plugins, so no web test is compiled there, and `vp run test:coverage:ts`
  measures source rather than the compiler's generated memoization code.

Node-environment tests that render mostly use `renderToStaticMarkup`, which
renders once, so they could not observe a stale memoized read anyway. Those
that render through `createRoot` on a hand-built happy-dom `Window` or stubbed
globals are still uncompiled, so they don't count as compiled coverage. A test
whose assertion depends on re-rendering, such as whether a hook reads state
again after an update, must render through React DOM in a happy-dom file. It
can pass from the root and still fail in CI, so verify it through the web
package: from `apps/web`, run `vp test run --project unit src/<path>.test.tsx`.
Where a global `vp` may shadow the workspace copy (native Windows, Parallels),
run `node ../../scripts/run-local-vp.mjs` with the same arguments.

`apps/web/src/reactEffectEventStaleness.test.tsx` pins the react-dom 19.2 defect
where Effect Events retain their first render's values in `memo(C)` without a
compare function, `forwardRef(C)`, and `memo(forwardRef(C), compare)`, despite a
committed prop update; plain functions and `memo(C, compare)` are controls.
The error rule `bibcode/no-effect-event-in-memo-or-forward-ref` refuses these
patterns in same-file components and hooks only; imported hooks and components
are not followed. Run the probe in the web package's compiled lane. If it fails
after a react-dom upgrade because a prohibited form starts returning the new
value, re-check every form and remove the rule only once all of them recover.

`apps/web/src/reactCompiler.test.tsx` guards the compiled lane. It fails when
happy-dom files stop running through the compiler, or when the compiler stops
caching the fixture's read by its arguments, for example after an upgrade of
`babel-plugin-react-compiler`. The root configuration excludes it, so running
that file from the root reports that no test files were found.
