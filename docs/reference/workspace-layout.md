# Repository Layout

## Product Applications

- `/apps/desktop`: Tauri 2 desktop host. Rust owns native lifecycle, windows,
  settings, menus, dialogs, updates, WSL/SSH preparation, and the in-process
  server lifecycle.
- `/apps/server`: Rust/Axum/Tokio server and native `bibcode` CLI. It owns
  providers, Git, files, terminals, persistence, orchestration, HTTP/WebSocket
  RPC, authentication, diagnostics, and relay integration.
- `/apps/web`: shared React 19 + Vite UI for browser and Tauri WebView modes.
- `/apps/marketing`: Astro marketing site; it is not part of the desktop or
  server production runtime.

## Packages And Infrastructure

- `/packages/contracts`: schema-only Effect/Schema contracts for the desktop
  bridge, WebSocket/RPC, providers, models, sessions, and persisted protocol
  values.
- `/packages/client-runtime`: shared connection supervision, RPC sessions,
  environment caches, and client state used by browser and desktop clients.
- `/packages/shared`: cross-runtime TypeScript utilities exposed through
  explicit package subpaths.
- `/infra/relay`: BiBCode Connect relay deployment package.
- `/oxlint-plugin-bibcode`: repository-specific Oxlint rules.
- `/tools/updater-verifier`: Rust tool used to verify signed updater artifacts.
- `/third_party/portable-pty`: vendored Rust PTY crate included in the Cargo
  workspace.

## Repository Support

- `/scripts`: development, build, release, measurement, and repository tooling.
  Scripts may use Node.js at development time; production does not.
- `/.repos`: read-only source references synchronized by `vp run sync:repos`.
  Application code must never import from this directory.
- `/assets`: source branding and packaging assets.
- `/patches`: package-manager patches applied to third-party dependencies.
- `/.github`: CI, release, packaged-smoke, deployment, and repository-policy
  workflows.

The Vite+ workspace includes `apps/*`, `infra/*`, `oxlint-plugin-bibcode`,
`packages/*`, and `scripts`. The Cargo workspace includes the desktop host,
native server, and updater verifier; `third_party/portable-pty` is consumed as a
local dependency.

## Runtime Boundaries

The frontend talks to the server through typed WebSocket/RPC contracts. In a
packaged desktop build, the Tauri Rust host starts the server in-process,
installs `window.desktopBridge`, and exposes only native host capabilities
through Tauri commands/events. Browser mode connects directly to a native
`bibcode` server and has no native bridge.

## UI Workspace Model

- A project is a repository/workspace root in an environment.
- Every project has a primary row backed by an undeletable default thread for
  the main checkout.
- Worktree rows are workspace threads with `worktreePath` set.
- Center chat panels are sibling threads with `kind: "panel"` that share the
  host worktree while owning their own provider session and transcript.
- Center surfaces are arranged into tab groups. Up to four groups can be shown
  as resizable horizontal or vertical split panes; each group has its own
  active surface, while one group owns focus and new-panel creation.
- Right-panel surfaces are per-thread tools: Plan, Diff, Source Control, Files,
  individual files, Preview, Terminal, and Activity. Preview is hidden when the
  active host does not report native preview support.

Center layout, focus, tab order, and split ratios persist across reloads. Closing
a split pane merges its tabs into the adjacent layout; explicitly closing a tab
closes its panel thread or terminal session as appropriate.

See [Workspace UI](../user/workspace-ui.md) for the user-facing model.
