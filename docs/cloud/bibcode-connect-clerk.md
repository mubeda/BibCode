# BiBCode Connect Clerk setup

BiBCode Connect uses one Clerk application for browser and desktop sign-in. The
relay accepts Clerk JWTs only from the configured issuer and audience. Clients
then exchange a Clerk token plus a DPoP proof for relay-scoped access; Clerk
tokens are not environment credentials.

## Client configuration

Cloud UI is disabled in a fresh clone. To enable it for source builds, add these
public values to the repository-root `.env.local` or `.env`:

```dotenv
BIBCODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable key>
BIBCODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=bibcode-relay
BIBCODE_RELAY_URL=https://relay.example.com
```

The shared loader projects canonical `BIBCODE_*` values into the `VITE_*`
aliases consumed by the web build. Precedence is:

1. process or CI environment variables;
2. repository-root `.env.local`;
3. repository-root `.env`.

These three values are public build-time configuration, not secrets. Web and
desktop builds omit Connect UI unless all three are valid. A built desktop
artifact does not need an environment file at runtime.

Never expose `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in a client environment, desktop artifact, or
repository file.

## Clerk JWT template

Create a template under **Clerk Dashboard > JWT templates**:

| Setting | Value                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Name    | `bibcode-relay`              |
| Claims  | `{ "aud": "bibcode-relay" }` |

Set `BIBCODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=bibcode-relay` for the client and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE=bibcode-relay` for the relay. The stable audience is shared
across deployment stages; `BIBCODE_RELAY_URL` chooses the concrete relay.

## Relay deployment

Copy `infra/relay/.env.example` to `infra/relay/.env` for a local deployment.
The relay reads `RELAY_DOMAIN`, `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`,
`RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` through Effect `Config`. `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is supplied as
an Alchemy secret.

`vp run --filter bibcode-relay deploy` runs Alchemy from `infra/relay`, so that
directory's environment file is loaded. After deployment, the wrapper writes
the deployed HTTPS relay URL to the repository-root environment configuration.

The `prod` Alchemy stage owns the retained PlanetScale database.
Non-production stages reference that database and provision isolated branches;
deploy `prod` before a personal developer stage.

## Client-driven link flow

Linking is initiated from the Connections settings in the running React client:

1. Clerk supplies a JWT from the configured template.
2. The client ensures the environment's managed relay binary is available.
3. The client requests a relay link challenge.
4. The local environment signs the challenge and endpoint descriptor.
5. The client submits the proof to the relay.
6. The relay provisions a managed endpoint and returns signed runtime
   configuration.
7. The client stores that configuration in the environment through its
   authenticated Connect API.

Unlinking clears the environment configuration first, then best-effort revokes
the cloud link. Environment link state is durable server state and is
reconciled when the server runs. The implementation entry points are
[`apps/web/src/cloud/linkEnvironment.ts`](../../apps/web/src/cloud/linkEnvironment.ts)
and
[`apps/server/src/production/connect_mcp.rs`](../../apps/server/src/production/connect_mcp.rs).

See [BiBCode Connect auth flow](./bibcode-connect-auth-flow.md) for the relay and
DPoP connection sequence.

## Desktop authentication

The Tauri desktop loads the same React app and `@clerk/react` provider as the
browser build. It does not use an Electron adapter or Electron token storage.
The production application identifier is `com.bibcode.desktop`.

Current Clerk flows must work inside the operating-system WebView. External-
browser native callbacks, custom `bibcode://` redirects, and native desktop
passkeys are not implemented. Do not claim them until a Tauri-specific secure
token transport, platform entitlements, and end-to-end tests exist.

## Private beta access

For request-and-approval access, enable **Clerk Dashboard > Waitlist** and
invite or deny requests there. Approved signed-in users manage Connect in the
Connections settings; signed-out users reach Clerk sign-in or waitlist UI from
those controls.

For a closed known-user beta, use **Restrictions > Allowlist** or Clerk's
restricted mode. An empty allowlist blocks all new sign-ups. Allowlisting
controls account creation; ban an existing user to terminate their Clerk
sessions and prevent future cloud sign-in.
