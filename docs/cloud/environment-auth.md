# Environment authentication profile

The environment server and the BiBCode Connect relay have separate issuers,
credentials, and trust boundaries. Both use OAuth-shaped tokens and scopes, but
an environment token is never valid at the relay and a relay token is never an
environment session.

## Environment scopes

Canonical scope constants are in
[`apps/server/src/auth/model.rs`](../../apps/server/src/auth/model.rs).

| Scope                   | Permission                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `orchestration:read`    | Read configuration, snapshots, events, filesystem/VCS state, and diagnostics. |
| `orchestration:operate` | Dispatch operations and mutate environment-side workspace state.              |
| `terminal:operate`      | Create, attach, write, resize, clear, restart, and close terminals.           |
| `review:write`          | Read diff previews used to compose review feedback.                           |
| `access:read`           | Inspect pairing links and authorized client sessions.                         |
| `access:write`          | Create or revoke pairing links and client sessions.                           |
| `relay:read`            | Read the environment's persisted Connect link state.                          |
| `relay:write`           | Install/configure the relay client and link or unlink the environment.        |

Ordinary pairing credentials grant:

```text
orchestration:read orchestration:operate terminal:operate review:write relay:read
```

Desktop and command-line administrative bootstraps additionally grant
`access:read`, `access:write`, and `relay:write`. The current
`cloud.getRelayClientStatus` and `cloud.installRelayClient` RPC methods require
`relay:write`; ordinary paired clients cannot invoke them. The exact RPC map is
[`required_scope`](../../apps/server/src/auth/scope.rs), and the Connect HTTP
route scopes are declared in
[`http_routes.rs`](../../apps/server/src/production/http_routes.rs).

## Bootstrap and session flows

### Browser session

`POST /api/auth/browser-session` consumes a one-time bootstrap credential and
creates an HTTP-only, SameSite browser session cookie. The response exposes the
granted scopes and expiry, not the session secret. Browser HTTP and WebSocket
ticket requests authenticate with this cookie.

### Bearer or DPoP token exchange

Non-cookie clients exchange a bootstrap at `POST /oauth/token` using an
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` OAuth token-exchange request:

```text
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
subject_token=<bootstrap credential>
subject_token_type=urn:bibcode:params:oauth:token-type:environment-bootstrap
requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
scope=orchestration:read orchestration:operate terminal:operate review:write relay:read
```

Requested scopes must be a subset of the bootstrap grant. Optional
`client_label`, `client_device_type`, and `client_os` values are presentation
hints for the authorized-clients UI; the environment does not use them for
authorization.

Without a `DPoP` proof header the response token type is `Bearer`. With a valid
proof, the issued access token is bound to the proof-key thumbprint and the
response token type is `DPoP`. Subsequent DPoP requests present both
`Authorization: DPoP <token>` and a fresh proof for the method and URL.

### WebSocket ticket

`POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket` accepts a valid cookie, bearer token, or DPoP
session and issues a short-lived, single-purpose ticket. The client opens
`/ws?wsTicket=<ticket>`; bearer and DPoP access tokens do not appear in the
WebSocket URL.

The ticket carries the session scopes, but each RPC still checks its own
required scope. Authentication therefore does not imply permission to call
every method. Tickets are bounded and consumed by
`authenticate_websocket` in
[`auth/http.rs`](../../apps/server/src/auth/http.rs).

## Access administration

Administrative sessions use the `/api/auth/pairing-*` and
`/api/auth/clients*` routes to create, inspect, and revoke credentials. Pairing
links are one-time bootstraps; successful exchange creates a separate bounded
client session. Revoking a pairing link prevents future exchange, while
revoking a client ends that client's current access.

Migration `031_AuthAuthorizationScopes` is a deliberate hard cutover from
role-bearing records to scoped records. It removes existing pairing links and
sessions without changing unrelated environment state. Upgraded clients must
pair again; old roles are not silently promoted to scopes.

### Protected local control

Host-local administration does not cross the HTTP/WebSocket authentication
boundary. Every native server owns a separate versioned control endpoint after
its persistent identity and authentication state are ready:

- macOS and Linux use `<state>/run/control.sock`. The existing or newly created
  parent must be owned by the service user with mode `0700`, the socket has mode
  `0600`, and the server checks peer credentials before reading a frame. A root
  peer is accepted for a non-root service only during an explicit managed
  service launch.
- Windows uses `\\.\pipe\bibcode-<environment-id>`. Each instance is created
  with an explicit protected DACL for the effective service-account SID and
  Builtin Administrators, a deny entry for network logons, and remote-client
  rejection. The server also validates the impersonated client token and
  fail-stops if it cannot revert impersonation.

The v1 protocol accepts one JSON request and one JSON response per connection,
framed by a four-byte big-endian length and capped at 64 KiB with a five-second
frame deadline. Its closed command inventory is `Status`, `CreatePairing`,
`ServicePrepareUpdate`, and `ServiceStop`; it is not a general RPC, SQL, shell,
filesystem, account, firewall, or purge channel. Public failures contain only a
stable code and safe message. Pairing values and pairing URLs are redacted from
debug output.

`Status` and `ServiceStop` are active. Update preparation is active only when
the desktop maintenance owner exists. `CreatePairing` is reserved but currently
returns `command_unavailable` until the five-minute, single-use CLI issuance
flow is implemented. Server shutdown stops control admission, drains accepted
requests, and removes a Unix socket only while its device/inode ownership still
matches this process; the database and runtime lock remain live until that
drain completes.

## Standards profile

- Bearer use follows the RFC 6750 authorization scheme.
- Token exchange uses the RFC 8693 request and response vocabulary.
- Scope strings use the RFC 6749 space-delimited subset model.
- DPoP-bound sessions verify the proof method, URL, key thumbprint, nonce when
  required, and access-token hash.

This is not a general-purpose OAuth authorization server. The environment
bootstrap token type, browser-session adapter, and WebSocket ticket are
product-specific, and API failures use BiBCode's typed HTTP/RPC error schemas.

## Relay boundary

The relay uses Clerk bearer tokens to identify cloud users and relay-issued
DPoP tokens for status/connect operations. It sends separately signed,
nonce-bound requests to an environment's public health and mint endpoints. The
environment validates those proofs and returns signed results before the relay
passes a bootstrap to the client. See
[BiBCode Connect auth flow](./bibcode-connect-auth-flow.md).
