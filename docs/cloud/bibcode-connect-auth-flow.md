# BiBCode Connect authentication flow

BiBCode Connect has three trust domains:

- Clerk authenticates the cloud user.
- The relay authorizes user-to-environment discovery and connect requests.
- Each environment issues and enforces its own scoped access sessions.

The relay is a control plane and managed-endpoint broker. After a connection
bootstrap is minted, the client authenticates directly to the environment over
the managed HTTPS/WSS endpoint.

## Link an environment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Signed-in BiBCode client
  participant Relay as Connect relay
  participant Env as Local environment

  Client->>Relay: POST /v1/client/environment-link-challenges (Clerk bearer)
  Relay-->>Client: challenge + expiry
  Client->>Env: POST /api/connect/link-proof
  Env-->>Client: environment-signed proof
  Client->>Relay: POST /v1/client/environment-links (Clerk bearer + proof)
  Relay-->>Client: environment link + managed endpoint configuration
  Client->>Env: POST /api/connect/relay-config
  Env-->>Client: durable link state
```

The client first ensures the environment can run the pinned managed relay
binary. The environment proof binds its stable identity, the relay issuer, the
challenge, the advertised endpoint, and the local origin used by the managed
connector. The relay verifies the proof before storing the link or provisioning
the endpoint.

Link-proof and relay-configuration routes require an environment session with
`relay:write`. Reading `/api/connect/link-state` requires `relay:read`;
`POST /api/connect/unlink` requires `relay:write`.

## Discover and connect

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Remote client
  participant Clerk as Clerk
  participant Relay as Connect relay
  participant Env as Linked environment

  Client->>Clerk: request bibcode-relay JWT
  Clerk-->>Client: Clerk JWT
  Client->>Relay: POST /v1/client/dpop-token (JWT + DPoP proof)
  Relay-->>Client: relay DPoP access token
  Client->>Relay: GET /v1/environments (Clerk bearer)
  Relay-->>Client: linked environments
  Client->>Relay: POST /v1/environments/:id/status (relay DPoP)
  Relay->>Env: POST /api/bibcode-connect/health (signed request proof)
  Env-->>Relay: signed health response
  Relay-->>Client: verified status
  Client->>Relay: POST /v1/environments/:id/connect (relay DPoP)
  Relay->>Env: POST /api/bibcode-connect/mint-credential (signed request proof)
  Env-->>Relay: DPoP-key-bound bootstrap + signed response
  Relay-->>Client: verified environment bootstrap
  Client->>Env: POST /oauth/token (bootstrap + DPoP proof)
  Env-->>Client: environment DPoP access token
  Client->>Env: POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket (DPoP)
  Env-->>Client: one-purpose WebSocket ticket
  Client->>Env: WSS /ws?wsTicket=...
```

Status and connect proofs bind the relay request to a nonce and operation. The
environment's mint response also binds the credential to the client's DPoP key
thumbprint. The relay verifies the environment signature but cannot use the
resulting credential as an environment session itself.

## Relay endpoints

The canonical API is
[`packages/contracts/src/relay.ts`](../../packages/contracts/src/relay.ts).

| Endpoint                                             | Authentication                                      | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`        | Public                                              | Relay issuer and token metadata.                         |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`          | Public                                              | Protected-resource and supported-scope metadata.         |
| `POST /v1/client/dpop-token`                         | Clerk token in the exchange payload plus DPoP proof | Issue a relay DPoP access token.                         |
| `GET /v1/environments`                               | Clerk bearer                                        | List the signed-in user's linked environments.           |
| `POST /v1/client/environment-link-challenges`        | Clerk bearer                                        | Create a bounded link challenge.                         |
| `POST /v1/client/environment-links`                  | Clerk bearer plus environment proof                 | Create or update an environment link.                    |
| `DELETE /v1/client/environment-links/:environmentId` | Clerk bearer                                        | Revoke an environment link.                              |
| `POST /v1/environments/:environmentId/status`        | Relay DPoP                                          | Request and validate signed environment health.          |
| `POST /v1/environments/:environmentId/connect`       | Relay DPoP                                          | Request and validate a DPoP-bound environment bootstrap. |

## Security invariants

- Clerk, relay, and environment credentials have distinct issuers and audiences.
- DPoP access tokens are bound to the client's proof key and request target.
- Relay-to-environment operations use signed, nonce-bound request proofs rather
  than a cloud-user token.
- The environment independently signs health and mint responses.
- Environment bearer or DPoP tokens never appear in WebSocket URLs; only a
  short-lived `wsTicket` does.
- A managed tunnel changes reachability, not environment authorization.
