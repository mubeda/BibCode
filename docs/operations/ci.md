# CI Quality Gates

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`. It has
four job groups:

- **Check** runs `vp check`, workspace typechecking (`vpr typecheck`),
  `cargo fmt --all --check`, Clippy with warnings denied, and the complete
  desktop build pipeline on Ubuntu 24.04. A separate
  `cargo check -p bibcode-server --lib --bins -j 2` also checks production
  feature wiring without dev units: all-targets Clippy enables the hermetic
  test guard, while ordinary server builds do not.
- **Test** runs every workspace package `test` script one task at a time with
  `vp run -r --concurrency-limit 1 test`, then runs `cargo test --workspace -j 2`
  explicitly on Ubuntu 24.04. Serial tasks keep `rustc` from competing with a
  running server or desktop suite, whose 2-second test deadlines have failed
  on starved hosted runners. Its 60-minute job budget covers setup, the package
  test graph, the Rust workspace suite, and SSH integration without changing
  any test-owned deadline. The `-j 2` bound limits concurrent Cargo compilation jobs; Rust
  test binaries use the default parallel harness threads. Exact subprocess
  tests may still select `--test-threads=1` inside an isolated child process
  that intentionally owns process-global state.
  The job then builds the guarded `bibcode` through
  `cargo test -p bibcode-server --test cli_smoke --no-run -j 2`
  and runs the ignored desktop SSH integration test
  (`cargo test -p bibcode-desktop --test ssh_environment -- --ignored`), which
  needs that fresh guarded binary and fakes only the SSH hop; see
  [Desktop-managed SSH environments](../testing/ssh-environments.md).
- **Release Smoke** runs `scripts/release-smoke.ts` to exercise release-only
  version rewriting, nightly metadata, and lockfile generation without
  publishing.
- **Native desktop** builds the web application, tests the desktop Rust host,
  and creates an unpublished native bundle on Linux ARM64/x64, Windows ARM64/x64,
  and macOS ARM64/x64 runners. Each matrix row declares its complete-job budget:
  240 minutes for macOS Intel, and 120 minutes for the other five targets.
  That budget includes setup, host tests, the macOS optimized exception-recovery
  probe, and native packaging without shortening any check or test-owned deadline.
  Debug host tests cannot warm the optimized artifacts; the optimized example
  also enables dev-dependency features (`tauri/test` and `tokio/test-util`) that
  the ordinary production bundle does not use. Both optimized commands select
  the same native target triple, but their feature differences require separate
  compilation. Keep the real exception probe: a larger complete-job allowance
  accommodates these deliberate checks without treating a cached build as the
  cold-build baseline. The shared `scripts/run-msvc.mjs` launcher selects
  the requested MSVC architecture. After the Rust host tests,
  the Windows row alone runs
  `vp test run apps/desktop/e2e/support/test-project.test.ts apps/web/src/components/gitManager/gitManagerRepositoryAvailability.test.ts`. That step is the
  supported native proof that the generated Cursor `.cmd` shim executes through
  the Windows command processor and writes its exact action record. Simulated
  target fixture assertions on other hosts are compatibility evidence, not a
  native Windows pass.
  The repository-availability contract additionally executes the generated
  drive/UNC trust commands through native Windows PowerShell and Git, including
  spaces, dollar signs, backticks, and typographic quotes. Every Git/home
  configuration input is fixture-owned. Other platforms skip that native case;
  their string assertions remain compatibility evidence.
  The Windows rows then run
  `node scripts/run-msvc.mjs cargo check -p bibcode-server --all-targets` so
  Unix-only test helpers or imports that are unused on Windows fail there under
  `-D warnings` instead of surfacing only during native validation; Clippy's
  `--all-targets` pass otherwise runs on Linux alone.

The Check and Test jobs install the Linux libraries required by Tauri. The
native matrix installs them only on Linux and otherwise uses each platform's
native toolchain. Node.js and Vite+ are development/build dependencies; release
artifacts contain the Tauri/Rust application and built web assets, not a Node
runtime or TypeScript server.

All workflows use the repository's declared Node.js 26.8.1, pnpm 11.25.0,
Vite+ 0.3.0, and Rust 1.98.0 toolchains. External setup actions are immutable

## Other Workflows

- `.github/workflows/linux-git-compatibility.yml` builds the real server Git
  runner regression test on Ubuntu 22.04, then executes it against system Git
  in Debian 12/13, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Fedora 44, and Arch rolling containers.
  It verifies AppImage library isolation for text and binary subprocesses,
  including inherited mounts from previous updates. This is Git compatibility
  evidence; native packaged desktop and updater validation remain separate.
- `.github/workflows/desktop-ui-smoke.yml` is a manual or reusable packaged-app
  UI smoke matrix for all six supported native targets.
- `.github/workflows/desktop-upgrade-smoke.yml` runs real seeded updater flows on
  all six targets; its WSL-specific lane remains Windows x64.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the stable/nightly release pipeline. See
  the [Release Checklist](./release.md). Its separate server matrix builds six
  archives, four Linux packages, and native distribution evidence before release
  assembly can create a draft.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` deploys the BiBCode Connect relay from
  `main` only when the required Cloudflare repository configuration exists.
- `.github/workflows/issue-labels.yml`, `pr-size.yml`, and `pr-vouch.yml` enforce
  repository-maintenance policy independently of the application quality
  gates.

When changing a workflow, update its focused workflow-contract tests and run
the repository gates documented in [Scripts](../reference/scripts.md).
Repeatable native manual and packaged validation follows the
[shared cross-platform runbook](../testing/cross-platform-validation.md) plus
the matching Windows, Linux, or macOS page in the
[testing runbook index](../testing/README.md).
